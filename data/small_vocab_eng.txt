I am always overwhelmed with a desire for your regulations.
You rebuke the arrogant; those who wander from your commands are cursed.

Give me understanding and I will obey your instructions; I will put them into practice with all my heart.
Make me walk along the path of your commands, for that is where my happiness is found.
Give me an eagerness for your laws rather than a love for money!
Turn my eyes from worthless things, and give me life through your word.*
Reassure me of your promise, made to those who fear you.
Help me abandon my shameful ways; for your regulations are good.
I long to obey your commandments! Renew my life with your goodness.

May all who fear you find in me a cause for joy, for I have put my hope in your word.

How long must I wait? When will you punish those who persecute me?
These arrogant people who hate your instructions have dug deep pits to trap me.
All your commands are trustworthy. Protect me from those who hunt me down without cause.
They almost finished me off, but I refused to abandon your commandments.
In your unfailing love, spare my life; then I can continue to obey your laws.
Your eternal word, O LORD, stands firm in heaven.

I rise early, before the sun is up; I cry out for help and put my hope in your words.
I stay awake through the night, thinking about your promise.
In your faithful love, O LORD, hear my cry; let me be revived by following your regulations.

But you are near, O LORD, and all your commands are true.
I have known from my earliest days that your laws will last forever.
Look upon my suffering and rescue me, for I have not forgotten your instructions.

The First Book of Moses, called Genesis
Hello
in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth
Now the earth was formless and empty,a darkness covered the surface of the watery depths, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters
Then God said, “Let there be light,”a and there was light
God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness
God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” There was an evening, and there was a morning: one day
And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so.
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so
And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it was] good.
 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
And the evening and the morning were the third day.
 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and or days, and years:
 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.
 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good.
 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creeps upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
 So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.
 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creeps upon the earth, wherein [there is] life, [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.
 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
 These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground.
 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
 And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
 The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where [there is] gold;
 And the gold of that land [is] good: there [is] bdellium and the onyx stone.
 And the name of the second river [is] Gihon: the same [is] it that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.
 And the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel: that [is] it which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.
 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 
 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eats thereof thou shalt surely die.
 And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof.
 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
 And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
 Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
 But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, you shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.
 And the serpent said unto the woman, you shall not surely die:
 For God doth know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
 And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where [art] thou?
 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [was] naked; and I hid myself.
 And he said, Who told thee that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
 And the man said, The woman whom thou gave [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What [is] this [that] thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou [art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and he shall rule over you.
 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed [is] the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life;
 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it you were taken: for dust thou [art,] and unto dust shalt thou return.
 And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
Joyful are people of integrity, who follow the instructions of the LORD.
Joyful are those who obey his laws and search for him with all their hearts.
They do not compromise with evil, and they walk only in his paths.
